# Federated Learning and Smartwatch Data Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the repository focusing on Federated Learning and its application using smartwatch data. This collection of Jupyter notebooks explores how Federated Learning allows multiple edge devices, such as smartwatches, to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing raw data, preserving user privacy.

## Contents

### Introduction to Federated Learning:
  Understand the concept of Federated Learning and its importance in decentralized model training.

### Basic Federated Learning Example:
  Simple Python code demonstrating how edge devices update a global model using Federated Learning principles.

### Advanced Federated Learning Techniques:
  Implementation of secure aggregation and differential privacy to enhance privacy protection in Federated 
  
### Learning scenarios.
#### Use Case: Smartwatch Data Analysis:
  Applying Federated Learning to analyze health data collected from smartwatches, focusing on model updates and aggregation.


# Use Case: Smartwatch Data Analysis

In the smartwatch data analysis scenario, three simulated smartwatches act as edge devices. Each smartwatch collects health data locally and updates the global model accordingly in a privacy-preserving manner. The notebooks provide step-by-step explanations and Python code to illustrate how Federated Learning enables collaborative model training while maintaining data privacy.

## Requirements

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy, Pandas (for data manipulation)

TensorFlow or PyTorch (for machine learning model simulations)
